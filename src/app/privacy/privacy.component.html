            <p>
                Cookies are small files that we or others send to and store on or with your computer so 
                that your computer, browser, mobile app or other application can be recognized as unique 
                the next time you access, visit, use or otherwise take advantage of the Services or other 
                media. Cookies may also reflect demographic data pertaining to you or other data linked to 
                information you submit. One use or consequence of cookies is to enable you to receive 
                customized ads, alerts, content, services or information. You are always free to decline 
                any cookies we use by adjusting the settings of your browser, as your browser may permit; 
                however, some products, services or features might not be available or operate properly if 
                cookies are not enabled. Some of our advertisers and third-party service providers may also 
                utilize their own cookies.
            </p>

            <p>
                In addition, we, our service providers and others sometimes use data-gathering mechanisms 
                on the Services, including without limitation “web beacons”, “clear GIFs”, “pixels” and/or 
                “tags”. These perform statistical and administrative functions, such as measuring site and 
                page traffic, verifying advertising paths, better understanding user interests and activity, 
                gathering related information (such as information relating to a particular browser, device 
                or IP address) and positioning images, and typically do so without detracting from your 
                online experience. Such mechanisms are not necessarily designed to collect Personal 
                Information. In addition, if you have provided your email address, we might use a non-human 
                unreadable form (or “hash”) of your email address to deliver, or facilitate delivery of, 
                relevant advertisements and information to you on or by way of the Services or on or by way 
                of other websites or media, including, for example, popular social media sites and features.
